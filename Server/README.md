## Purpose
This server is created to transform number inputs into strings.

## Approach
Because of the simplicity of the logic, the transformations are done directly in the Program.cs file. No database is connected and no environment variables are required, since these were not necessary to the functionality of the app.

## Testing
To run this server, run:

```
dotnet run
```

Endpoints were also tested using Postman by the developer (Jo Rocca).
